## 🚀 Planned Features

- **Student Management**  
  Teachers can register new students with details like name, student number, department, class, and photo. Form validations ensure required fields are filled and student numbers are unique.

- **Automatic Attendance**  
  Live camera feed captures student faces. The system automatically recognizes students, records attendance, and provides real-time feedback. Teachers can manually add attendance for unrecognized students.

- **Reporting and Tracking**  
  View attendance records daily or per student. Filter by date, class, or department. Export attendance lists as PDF or CSV. Edit records manually if needed.
