📷 Smart Attendance System

This is a web-based system that allows a teacher to take attendance automatically by recognizing students via a web camera. The goal is to speed up the attendance process, automate it, and minimize manual errors.

🛠️ Planned Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: Web interface for teachers to manage students, view live camera feed, and check reports.
	•	Backend: API server for saving student data, running face recognition, and serving reports.
	•	Database: Stores student information (including photos) and attendance records.
	•	Artificial Intelligence (AI): Face recognition and matching module using stored student photos.
